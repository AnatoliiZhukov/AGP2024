Hi! This is a beginner level first-person project made in **Unreal Engine 5.3** where you need to use your axe to escape from some... underground cave place... filled with archers for some reason?
### This project features:
- Mechanics written in C++
- A first-person character able to run, crouch smoothly, jump, sprint, attack, take damage
- Animated enemies able to locate the player, lose the player, attack, take damage
  - Enemy model and animations taken from Mixamo
- Object pools for arrows for every actor that is capable of shooting them
- Attack system
- Deflect system
  - Damage an arrow to start deflecting
  - Any arrow that gets into your attack range while deflecting gets destroyed
- Custom core classes such as PlayerController, HUD, Camera Manager
- A custom environment modeled in Blender
- A first-person rig created pretty much from scratch in Blender
- Custom first-person animations created from scratch in Blender
- Main menu and UI with animations
- A generic interaction system that uses delegates
- W/L conditions with different ending sequences
- A custom world subsystem
- Emissive and world-aligned materials
- Probably some other things I forgot about

### Controls:
WASD - movement
Left Mouse Button - axe attack
Space - jump
CTRL - crouch/dodge
Shift - sprint

### Will this project ever be updated?
No, I initially planned to continue working on it, but decided to move on to other projects.
You are welcome to copy the code, but please note that it may not be of high quality as it was written by a beginner/intermediate Unreal Engine user (me).
